		/*
		* toString
		*
		* Returns a string representation of the current maze. Returns a maze of all 1s if no maze
		* has yet been generated or imported.
		*
		* A valid string representation of a maze consists only of 125 1s and 0s (each separated
		* by spaces) arranged in five 5x5 grids (each separated by newlines) with no trailing newline. A valid maze must
		* also have 1s in the entrance cell (0, 0, 0) and in the exit cell (4, 4, 4).
		*
		* Cell (0, 0, 0) is represented by the first number in the string representation of the
		* maze. Increasing in x means moving toward the east, meaning cell (1, 0, 0) is the second
		* number. Increasing in y means moving toward the south, meaning cell (0, 1, 0) is the
		* sixth number. Increasing in z means moving downward to a new grid, meaning cell
		* (0, 0, 1) is the twenty-sixth cell in the maze. Cell (4, 4, 4) is represented by the last number.
		*
		* Returns:		string
		*				A single string representing the current maze

		* The generated maze must contain a roughly equal number of 1s and 0s and must have a 1
		* in the entrance cell (0, 0, 0) and in the exit cell (4, 4, 4).  The generated maze may be
		* solvable or unsolvable, and this method should be able to produce both kinds of mazes.

		* Does nothing if the file does not exist or if the file's data does not represent a valid
		* maze.
		*
		* The file's contents must be of the format described above to be considered valid.

		//Part 3-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		/*
		* solveMaze
		*
		* Attempts to solve the current maze and returns a solution if one is found.
		*
		* A solution to a maze is a list of coordinates for the path from the entrance to the exit
		* (or an empty vector if no solution is found). This list cannot contain duplicates, and
		* any two consecutive coordinates in the list can only differ by 1 for only one
		* coordinate. The entrance cell (0, 0, 0) and the exit cell (4, 4, 4) should be included
		* in the solution. Each string in the solution vector must be of the format "(x, y, z)",
		* where x, y, and z are the integer coordinates of a cell.
		*
		* Understand that most mazes will contain multiple solutions
		*
		* Returns:		vector<string>
		*				A solution to the current maze, or an empty vector if none exists
